## The challenge:

Create a file named `objects.js`.

In that file, define a variable named `pizza`:

Create an Object literal with the following key and values:

```js
toppings - Array, crust - String, serves - Number;
```

Use `console.log()` to print the `pizza` object to the terminal.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

```bash
