## The challenge:

Create a file named `array-filtering.js`.

In that file, define a variable named `numbers` that references this array:

```js
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```

And filter by even numbers.

Pay close attention to the syntax used throughout your solution. Use `console.log()` to print the `filtered` array to the terminal.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

```bash
javascripting verify array-filtering.js
```
